# Field_Service_Tracker
Project web page to track field service reports for each month with simple login and database.

Field Service Tracker is a PHP-based web app that keeps records of various activities throughout the day, month, and year.  This was a personal project, and the goal was to become familiar with PHP and database interaction.  This app is a digital method for accurately keeping track of activity daily, monthly, and yearly activity.

***GENERAL INFORMATION***
Once registering on the website, users are stored in the database and have the ability to log on and input data for the day.  Each time a user records their activity, the daily, monthly, and yearly activity is updated in the database and displayed on the page.

Pages are protected so as to allow only those logged in to fully interact with the app.  Users can log out any time.

***GETTING STARTED***
When visiting fstracker.justinrichardweb.com a login screen is prepared.  A link to register is below the login section, allowing user to create new accounts for the app.  After registering, users can use the information given to log in.  Once logged in, a page that allows for data input will be shown.  This page is used to update the userâ€™s information.  Below that section are the display sections.  Daily, monthly, and yearly statistics are displayed for the user to view.  These statistics are updated every time the user adds more data.  An option to log out is in the top right corner of the page.

***TECHNOLOGIES USED***
PHP 5.5.12
MySQLi
MySQL Database 5.6.17
HTML5/CSS
Javascript/jQuery

***FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS***
I hope to redesign this app in a way that does not require the page to refresh when data is updated.  Eventually I would like to employ some AJAX to make things cleaner.
